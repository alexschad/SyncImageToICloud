## Demo on how to Sync images to the icloud document folder

Example react Native App that lets the user select an image from the image library and then syncs it to
the icloud documents folder. The other device checks if the file is in the cloud and lets the user
download it from the cloud to the device.
It uses the icloud key/value store to store and sync the filename.
